For more details on new features, please check the [Manual](./MANUAL.md).

<details><summary>8.2.0 - 18 April 2023</summary>

### Added
- `[substring]`: you can now pass strings into the `start` and `end` arguments and it will find the index of those strings within the content
- `[zoom_enhance]`: included `negative_mask` in the Wizard UI

### Changed
- `[txt2mask]`: setting `method="sam"` will attempt to install the required GroundingDINO library automatically, YMMV
- `[array]`: fixed crash related to `_shuffle`
- Unprompted will now store downloaded models into `models` rather than `lib_unprompted`
- On startup, Unprompted will move its models to the new location

</details>

<details><summary>8.1.0 - 17 April 2023</summary>

### Added
- You can now use `[set]` to manage various ControlNet settings
- Bodysnatcher: new setting `use_optimized_inference_settings`
- Bodysnatcher: new setting `use_controlnet_preset`
- `[zoom_enhance]`: implements the `color-matcher` library for higher quality swaps
- `[zoom_enhance]`: supports `color_correct_method` to choose from different grading algorithms, or disable color correction by setting this to `none`
- `[zoom_enhance]`: supports `color_correct_strength` which is an integer that determines how many times to run the `color_correct_method`
- `[zoom_enhance]`: the `adaptive_hires` feature will now ajdust CFG scale and apply a bit of sharpening
- Wizard UI `number` elements can now specify `_minimum` and `_maximum` value range (however, this isn't supported by Gradio yet)
- Specified default values for Wizard UI `slider` elements to prevent crashing

### Changed
- `[zoom_enhance]`: speculative fix for final image not showing up in the output window

- Bodysnatcher: debug images are no longer saved by default, but you can toggle them in the UI

</details>

<details><summary>8.0.0 - 16 April 2023</summary>

### Added
- New `Bodysnatcher` GUI template
- New option `Unprompted.Config.beta_features` to opt into unfinished doodads
- Unprompted now creates a copy of the `p` object at the beginning of the `process()` routine named `Unprompted.p_copy`, which allows for greater compatibility with extensions that hijack the inference pipeline (e.g. ControlNet)
- With the help of the above change, `[zoom_enhance]` is now compatible with ControlNet
- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode now applies a sharpening filter to the final image as determined by the `sharpen_amount` arg
- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode now supports manual mask behavior `mode` similar to `[txt2mask]`
- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode seeks to improve support with `Only Masked` mode by scaling up some settings to account for your original image resolution
- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode supports `bypass_adaptive_hires` to disable the above behavior
- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode now supports `hires_size_max` which limits the adaptive resolution to avoid OOM errors (defaults to 1024)
- Wizard Templates now support `[wizard_ui_accordion]` to group a collection of settings into a collapsible menu
- Wizard Template UI elements now support `_info` for showing descriptive text
- New `Known Issues` section in the manual
- The `[txt2mask]` shortcode now supports the Segment Anything Model with GroundingRINO (set `method="sam"`), although you need to install the latter manually--it doesn't work with pip at the time of writing--and I'm not particularly impressed by its results compared to clipseg (after installing manually: you'll need to move GroundingRINO into your `venv` folder and replace any `import groundingrino` calls with relative imports e.g. `import ...utils.something`)
- CSS style for prose hyperlinks so I can actually see the darn things

### Changed
- Wizard Functions have been renamed to Wizard Templates
- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode now runs the native `process_images_inner()` function as opposed to piggybacking the `[img2img]` shortcode
- The `[zoom_enhance]` `save` parg has been renamed to `debug`
- Increased the `[zoom_enhance]` `mask_size_max` default value from 0.3 to 0.5
- A bit of UI polish
- Fixed a crash related to calling `Unprompted.parse_alt_tags()` with an empty string
- Fixed typo related to Wizard Template radio buttons
- Fixed CSS padding of list elements in the latest version of WebUI
- Fixed CSS spacing between `<detail>` elements
- Fixed Wizard Template radio button default value
- Fixed an issue with nested Wizard UI event listeners
- Wizard UI values are updated on Gradio's unfocus event due to the unreliable nature of the `change()` event as demonstrated here: https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/issues/3876
- Improved logging in various places
- Wizard Templates are now explicitly loaded as `utf8` (compatible with emoji ðŸ˜Ž)

### Removed
- The `settings` placeholder UI files for the time being, although I would like to implement a UI for `config_user.json` eventually

- New `[txt2mask]` setting `unload_model` to disable the above behavior
- The `[zoom_enhance]` Wizard UI now includes `unload_model`
- New `[zoom_enhance]` setting `upscale_method`
- The `[zoom_enhance]` default upscaling method is now Nearest Neighbor which should result in a more accurate final image
- New `[zoom_enhance]` setting `downscale_method` which controls the resample filter used with the final image

- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode now supports `mask_sort_method` which determines the order of multiple matching regions, defaults to `left-to-right`
- The `[zoom_enhance]` shortcode will now adjust CFG scale dynamically, in the same fashion as denoising strength
- The `[zoom_enhance]` Wizard GUI now lets you override `denoising_strength` and `cfg_scale` with arbitary values, bypassing the "dynamic" mechanism

The `[controlnet]` shortcode is now considered a "legacy" feature as it is generally less robust than [Mikubill's dedicated ControlNet extension](https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet).

- New shortcode `[min]` for returning the value of the smallest variable among the arguments
- New shortcode `[max]` for returning the value of the greatest variable among the arguments
- New shortcode `[unset]` that removes one or more variables from memory
- New function `parse_advanced` that consolidates calls to simpleeval

- New example `reverse_string.txt`

### Changed
- Secondary shortcode tags have been changed from `<>` to `{}` for compatibility with advanced expression statements
- Updated example `update_variable.txt`
- Fixed potential crash related to `autocast` function
- Fixed a bug in the `[sets]` shortcode
- Fixed a couple bugs related to advanced expressions

### Removed
- The `[repeat]` shortcode no longer supports `_times` as the first argument now automatically accepts expressions and secondary shortcode tags
- The `[switch]` shortcode no longer supports `_var` as the first argument now automatically accepts expressions and secondary shortcode tags

> **Important Note:** the change to secondary shortcode tags will unfortunately break some existing templates. In general, I try to avoid making such changes, but in this case it was the best way to get secondary tags to interact well with advanced expressions - the <> characters conflicted with less-than, greater-than conditional checks. On the plus side, we can now do stuff like this: [if "{file some_script} < 2"]print me[/if]. Should be quite powerful!

> If you wish to revert this behavior (not recommended) you can do so by creating a file called config_user.json, setting advanced_expressions to false, tag_start_alt to <, and tag_start_end to >. Refer to config.json for exact formatting. Be aware that these changes will break advanced expressions.
